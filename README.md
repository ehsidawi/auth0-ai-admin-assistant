This Auth0 AI Admin Assistant extension provides a powerful natural language interface that enables administrators to manage their Auth0 tenant without manual processes. Powered by leading AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google, administrators can simply chat with the assistant to create users, configure clients, manage connections, implement rules, and perform other administrative tasks through conversational commands rather than navigating complex dashboards or writing code. The extension includes comprehensive security controls with permission verification and confirmation prompts for destructive actions, detailed audit logging for compliance and troubleshooting, support for multiple AI providers that can be configured based on your preference and existing API keys, and a real-time chat interface with immediate feedback as commands are processed. Simply install this extension, configure your preferred AI provider, and start managing your Auth0 tenant through natural languageâ€”eliminating the need for complex manual processes while maintaining security and control.
